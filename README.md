# Survival Horde
Scripted CO-OP map I created for video game Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance back in 2016-2017.

You are sent on a stealth mission deep in enemy territory. The situation turns dire when the enemy finds out about your plans. Vastly outnumbered, you start preparing for the last stand. Works with 1-4 player (unoccupied lanes are disabled, resources and enemies are spawned according to player count). Installation: Just launch the map. Difficulty: Pretty hard.
